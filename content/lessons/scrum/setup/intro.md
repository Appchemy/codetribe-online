Welcome to the Beginner React tutorial. If you have never coded in React, then this is the best place to start.

React is based on JavaScript, HTML and some level of understanding on CSS. A prerequisite to continue with the lesson is to have some basic understanding on the technologies above. If you don't, my recommendation is that you checkout some tutorials on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com).

There are two ways you can follow these lessons. Either by installing React on your machine (which I personally recommend), or you can code on your browser using [Codepen](https://codepen.io). Each lesson has a Codepen link you can use to play around with the lesson content.

In this chapter, I'll be taking you through the process of installing React on your machine. If you plan to use Codepen for now, you can skip this section. However, I recommend you return here the moment you are ready to start coding on your machine.
