When creating apps in Ionic, you can choose from the following three options to start with: 

## Tab App

If you want to use the Ionic tabs template, the app will be built with the tab menu, header and a couple of useful screens and functionalities. This is the default Ionic template. 

## Blank App

If you want to start from scratch, you can install the Ionic blank template. This template wonâ€™t have any functionality added to it. 

## SideMenu App

The third template that you can use is the Side Menu Template. That comes with Side Menu functionalities. 

First we will open our command window and navigate to where we want to create our app, for this tutorial we are going to create our app on the desktop using the blank template. To do so type the following command in your command window. C:\Users\Username> cd Desktop

This command will change the working directory to the Desktop, where we will create our first app.

By typing the following command and pressing enter on your keyboard will create a folder named myApp on our Desktop and setup Ionic files and folders. 

```bash
C:\Users\Username\Desktop> ionic start myApp Blank
```

The command Ionic start is used to create Ionic files which we can use to build our ionic app on. After running this command, we will be presented with two framework options Angular and React. For this tutorial we are going to use Angular. 

Now we will be prompt to integrate our new app with Capacitor to target native IOS and Android? We will simply type Y to indicate Yes to make sure we build one app for both platforms.

Now, we want to access the myApp folder that we just created. This is our root folder. We will navigate into our myApp folder by typing the following command. 

```bash
C:\Users\Username\Desktop> cd myApp
```

The next command will open your app in the web browser. Google Chrome provides the device mode functionality for mobile development testing. Press F12 to access the developer console 

```bash
C:\Users\Username\Desktop> cd myApp
```
