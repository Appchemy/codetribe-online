chapter: 1
lesson: 3

In the following lessons, we'll learn the basics of creating wonderful UI's(user interface) for apps, CMS's(Content Management Systems) and Dashboards(If you're not familiar with these terms, please refer to your facilitator). User Interface is the first impression you make to the end users. You've always heard that the first impression is always vital for any interview and that is accompanied with the way you're dressed from your head to your toes and the way you conduct yourself such as interpersonal skills etc. It is the same thing with UI, you always want to impress your users with great looks and experience of your solution.

> The way you'd prepare for an interview is the same way you'd prepare for creating UI and the same way you'd like to impress during an interview is the same way your UI should impress users.

There are many ways to approach UI, There are thousands of articles on how to approach design on the internet but we've tried to simplify the complexities of learning a thousand ways of doing the same thing by preparing the following steps. 

**Step 1:**

Familiarise yourself with design principles of both iOS and Android to help you in building amazing and relevant designs for each platform or according to the requirements.

Android and IOS have different principles that you go through both principles to align yourself with either platform. Both these platforms(Google Play Store and Apple App Store) will not allow your app on their respective app stores unless you adhere to their design principles. This includes but not limited to icons, layout, button sizes, image backgrounds etc. For full understanding of these principles, please explore the following:

- https://material.io/develop/ios/ 
- https://material.io/develop/web/ 

**Activity:**

- As you may have learnt about icons, can you download any type of an icon
- from the internet to use it on your project?
- What is the best format for your icons?
- Explain what do you understand by primary colour, primary colour dark and
- accent colour in android design principles.
- Discuss with your other colleagues on the importance of responsiveness
- and on what makes great design.

To be good in design, you must befriend material.io.

**Step 2:**

By now you should have an idea and knowledge on the design principles of each platform. For the next step, we will list what we think are the most important things to do as soon as you have all the specifications for the project. 

While putting everything you have learnt into considerations;

- Document and realise the scope of the project in point form. 
- From your points above, group items that you think are related. 
- Before creating wireframes, map out a target user flow of your project. Please refer to the image link below:

Now sketch out using pencil and paper a wireframe. An example of a wireframe is;![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WI6h2cJMzY3TGJXNyS8oKrvSqsfiZQLLVfZ4MunZyacGBMC5FleRy5VBKbkpD5PAAyhtqrjv0BTFnwKXdW_3ESnwYR3Up1IaPCCj92t_Dm66mgHnggTyKVnYtpBl-T4oyVTZ9ze-)

- 
  The above example demonstrates wireframes of a mobile view of the project with navigation of each screen. This is how wireframes should look like and you are welcome to use freehand for your wireframes. 
- Take great care to the amount of screens(or pages). 
- The number of screens must be kept to a minimum but still be able to achieve the main goal of the project. 
- Keep in mind that for each screen you add to your project, you're adding a navigation backlog for the user.
- Do not add unnecessary screens. 
- Please take note that most modern phones have bigger screens, so make sure users can have ease in using your app(Usability is precious). 
- Take note of all usability events I.e. one handed, cradled and two handed.

- Keep the project to the simplest form it can be.
- Keep the user in your thoughts throughout the sketching and wireframing process.
